# CEH-PRACTICAL-V12-guide
new changes made and most underrated things that I know one discussed.

In this report, I'm skipping the stuff everyone already knows about CEH practical training. I trust you're familiar with these basics. My main focus will be on the hidden treasures—the tips and advice that often don't get the attention they deserve. These underrated insights can boost your skills and make a real difference. We'll dig into these less-talked-about aspects, aiming to help you become better at navigating the CEH Version 12 Exam.

You might notice a few points that appear more than once in this report, but there's a reason behind it. Each repetition is intentional and serves to examine the topic from a different angle. It's like looking at a problem through various lenses to truly understand it. We're not just saying the same thing again, but rather emphasizing important aspects from different perspectives. This approach is aimed at helping you grasp the subject better and see the bigger picture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

# POINTS THAT NO ONE NOTED
## 1. V11 vs V12
### ~ first of all let's know the changes made in the new CEH v12 practical examination.
- The new v12 made the exam harder but not impossible, so don't get demotivated.
- It is not ilabs that conducting the exam, the exam is now been conducted by Cyber Q.
- The procedure for solving the problem is a bit lengthy and a bit complex.
- Questions were changed ( so those who illegally brought the answer dumps please dump them off.)
- New topics were added and most of the questions are from these new topics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. It's not love, The cloud is in the air:
- You should realize that the machine you are using during the examination is not your high-end attack machine but the cloud.
- It could be slow and sometimes very slow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Not the ilabs but CyberQ:
- As said earlier the exam is not been conducted by the ilabs. Now it's been conducted by CyberQ.
- So if you are planning to buy a lab subscription, make sure you buy the CyberQ subscription.
- By this, you be familiar with the exam platform interface and learn the topics that are updated in v12.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. NEW NEW NEW:
- Though new questions were added and the complexity of solving the problem was increased, but most of the things were covered from the lab manual itself.
- Make sure you have the latest v12 lab manual.
- The questions were scenario-based so you may feel that they are new, but don't panic read and understand the question properly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. '-t' could be a dead end:
- If you are a person who performs attacks using more threads for fast results.
- Please go with the default threads for the tool.
- Using more threads would drain the resources and you end up rebooting the system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Feel the network:
- Take time and understand the network clearly.
- It's definitely worth your time.
- As per the new update now we have a 3/24 network. So understanding the network helps you in performing the enumeration and attack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 7. answers_tmp.txt
- Note your answers in a temporary file so that when the platform is erased due to any technical issue there will be nothing to worry about.
- This could happen very rarely and proctors too ask to store answers in the file but sometimes they may forget.
- But do not forget to clear them after the examination to be a certified "ETHICAL" hacker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 8. is zenmap for noobs?
- I know that you may criticize me after this point, but it should be mentioned.
- We all love terminals and commands with green font colors.
- But as I said it's a cloud machine and they could be slow and surfing through them could be irritating because of this slowness and latency issues.
- I would honestly recommend using zenmap so that you can re-check the performed scans easily and focus more on the exam questions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 9. Listen to them closely:
- Everyone says the two machines that are given for the exam are Windows and Parrot ( if you don't know that it's not Kali then you are far behind ) Linux.
- It's not Windows and Parrot but Windows in Parrot, hope you got it.
- so learn to work in rdp.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 10. 1 module != 1 mark:
- If you are thinking of leaving a module and it costs only one mark you could lose.
- The questions are interconnected and secinero-based so you may need to perform some procedures that you might have skipped.
- Mainly if you are planning to skip modules like cryptography and web app pen testing, then you may regret it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 11. Not long they are detailed:
- Most of the questions look too lengthy.
- but there is a catch, all those questions are scenario-based and explained in detail.
- so read the question completely, understand the given scenario, take the given details, and go for the accurate shot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 12. CyberQ exposed:
- Go to the cyberQ official platform, there you can find two free labs to perform.
- Though they are very basic questions, just do this so that you can feel familiar with the platform during the examination.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 13. Free THM:
- There are many free machines in Try Hack Me that you can find easily so I am not going to mention them.
- But do use that free 1 hour Attack box in Try Hack Me, so that you can relate to working with another machine during the exam.
- mostly the speed of the cloud machines is as same as your Attackbox.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 14. Find your grep:
- Do practice with find and grep commands thoroughly, helps you a lot.
- Try finding the required file to understand what to exploit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 15. Time isn't too short or isn't too long:
- Before the v12 I heard everyone saying that they completed in just 4 hours but after v12 most of them started saying 6 hours is not enough.
- I felt that the time given was decently enough for me compared with the speed of the machine I got.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 16. Skimming makes you lose:
- During your examination, there could be a point where you have solved all the easy questions and you are unable to find any more.
- If this happens it would be better to focus on 2 or 3 questions at a time that could be solved, rather than going for solving all the questions in a confused way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 17. Let your parrot talk:
- The Kali Linux has some features like completing your used commands and all tools path is been set.
- Therefore do practice in the Parrot security edition, So that you won't feel overwhelmed during the exam.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 18. Cryptography is the key:
- If you are not following the lab manual for preparation, then at least go through the cryptography module and try out the given tools.
- This saves a lot of time for sure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 19. On-demand exam portal:
- Do plan your exam at least 20 days before the date.
- after the version's arrival demand has been increased and the session date blocked first in hand.
- Do check the portal regularly so that you won't need to postpone your exam due to no free exam dates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 20. Final card:
- If the given cloud machine is too slow you can't perform anything.
- Try to open in another browser, check internet speed, and try re-opening or re-logging.
- If nothing helps then explain the situation to the proctor and ask the proctor to cancel the exam.
- You can mail to the EC-council for rescheduling for free, If they feel your problem is genuine then they definitely reschedule the exam for free.
- But it could be only done if you are genuinely facing the problem and have no other choice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 21. Resources:
- Once you have completed your preparation, watch YouTube playlists created by 'The Penteser Guy' and 'Caveman Tech'
- especially go through the comments of this video[https://youtu.be/GgL6v_OoPEc?si=h2nt_2j-XBsU2ywM]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## 22. Be specific; use specialized:
- There are tools mentioned in the module that are light and specifically used for a purpose.
- Use these tools instead of generic tools which would take heavy resources and time for running.

### Some points might seem trivial, yet these are the very ones I wish I had known earlier.
### If a point resonates or brings value, a small nod with a star would be gold! Help this post shine for others too. ⭐
